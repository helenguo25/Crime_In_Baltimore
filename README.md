This paper investigates the relationship between crime occurrences and the time of day in Baltimore, employing Poisson regression with confidence intervals adjusted for dispersion, to analyze time series data. Frequency of criminal activity impacts prevention strategies and resource allocation, piquing the interest of researchers and law enforcement agencies alike. Our analysis reveals variations in mean crimes per hour throughout the day, notably rising during daylight hours and peaking in the evening. These temporal crime patterns exhibit unique trends by type of crime, with larceny crimes contributing the most to the aggregate variation. The results from this paper outline these differences and underscore the importance of a mix of interventions temporally tailored toward aggregate crime and specific crime categories.
